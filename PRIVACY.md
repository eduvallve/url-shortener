- **No Personal Information**: We do not require registration, names, emails, or any other personal identifiers.
- **No Cookies**: We do not use tracking cookies or third-party analytics that identify individual users.

## 2. Information We Store
The only information stored in our database is:
- **Shortened URLs**: The original long URL you provide.
- **Short Codes**: The randomly generated code associated with the URL.
- **Usage Statistics**: The total number of redirects (clicks) for each short link.
- **Timestamps**: The date and time when the URL was shortened.
- **Abuse Reports**: If a URL is reported, we store the code and the reason for the report.

## 3. Data Usage
The stored information is used exclusively to:

- Display aggregate usage statistics.
- Moderation: Identify and remove URLs that violate our Terms of Service.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties, except as required by our service providers (e.g., Turso for database hosting) to provide the service, or as required by law.

## 5. Your Rights (GDPR)
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users have the right to access, rectify, or erase their personal data. However, since we do not store any personal data that can identify you, we have no means of linking specific URLs to individual users.

If you find a URL that contains your personal information or violates your privacy, please use the **Report Abuse** feature on the website to request its removal.
